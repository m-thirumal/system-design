# system-design

A good design means that your system will keep running smoothly, using resources efficiently and providing fast and accurate results to the business.

### Problem analysis in system design

* Understand full scope of requirements
* Understanding Trade-offs 
* Reliability and Fault Tolerance - when things go wrong -  redundancy, backups, and automatic recovery to keep the system running with minimal downtime
* Depth of Technical Knowledge -  knowledge of databases, data processing frameworks, network basics, and when to use specific algorithms or data structures
* Holistic Thinking
    * System design isn’t just about individual components — it’s about seeing the big picture.
    * This means considering the entire flow: from data ingestion, processing, and storage to how the data is presented.
    * It also includes non-functional needs like security, compliance, monitoring, and maintainability.
* Iterative Refinement

### Key Components to Consider in System Design

* Scalability - As data keeps growing in size, speed, and variety, your system must be able to scale without slowing down or breaking. A scalable design means you won’t need to rebuild everything or spend a fortune when traffic increases.
* Reliability - Reliable data systems are critical for business operations, analytics, and decision-making. If the system goes down, it can lead to bad insights, operational delays, or even lost revenue.
* Data Integrity - If your data is wrong or corrupted, it can lead to bad business decisions, loss of trust, and even compliance risks. A strong system must ensure that data stays accurate, consistent, and reliable from start to finish.
* Latency and Throughput - Every business use case is different — some need real-time data (low latency), while others need to process large amounts of data quickly (high throughput). A good system balances both based on what the business needs most.
* Security and Compliance - A data breach can lead to heavy fines, lost customer trust, and serious damage to a company’s brand. On top of that, many industries must follow strict regulatory rules on how data is stored, used, and shared.
